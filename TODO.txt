Fix how Equipment slots work
Should we build server side handling of wrap lines (eg room descriptions)
Config for player settings (prompt, info etc)


Mandel list:
- can't cast to open combat
+ names not auto capitalized
+ scan is ugly

Things to think about:
- should I use dataclasses?
- should I change when password is saved in password db (ie only after character is created)
- change login routine?
